# Jungle Beat

An implementation of linked list that allows you to enter syllabuls and has the computer play them back to you:

```
> require "./lib/jungle_beat"
> jb = JungleBeat.new
=> <JungleBeat list=<LinkedList head=nil #234567890890> #456789045678>
> jb.append("deep doo ditt woo hoo shu")
=> "deep doo ditt woo hoo shu"
> jb.count
=> 6
> jb.list.count
=> 6
> jb.play
=> # plays the sounds deep doo ditt woo hoo shu
```
